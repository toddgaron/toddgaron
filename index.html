				I was born in Los Angeles and grew up in the suburbs of San Francisco. I went to Reed College in Portland, Oregon where I worked with Professor Joel Franklin and wrote my thesis under Professor Nelia Mann. I'm now, as you've already read, at UW - Madison.

	    		I am a graduate student in the Phenomenology group at UW Madison working for Professor Lisa Everett doing mostly supersymmetric model building. Below are some descriptions of some projects that are complete or near to that. Currently I'm interested in or working on supersymmetric models where R-parity is violated outside of the superpotential and lepton mass models with generalized CP symmetries. My CV is available <a href="/Users/todd/Downloads/dhg-Skeleton-7ab6820/media/ToddSGaron.CV.pdf"download="ToddSGaron.CV.pdf" class="download-button" >here</a> or you can look at my <a id="linkedin" href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=261671071">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

	    		<h3 class="subsection-header">Flavor Symmetries in Flavored Gauge Mediation Scenarios</h3>
				<p>
	    		My current research with Professor Lisa Everett at UW Madison focuses on looking at a class of flavored gauge mediated SUSY breaking scenarios. In gauge mediation, we introduce an extra 5 <span style="text-decoration:overline">5</span>
			 pair of SU(5) multiplets that couple to some spurion field that gains a vev and a SUSY breaking F-term vev. When these massive fields integrate out they generate gaugino masses at one loop and soft scalar masses at two loops. In flavored gauge mediation we decompose the SU(5) 5 into a 3 and a 2 where the doublet has the same quantum numbers as a MSSM Higgs allowing us to couple them to matter fields through Yukawa couplings. My work looks at makings these additional Higgs partners of the MSSM Higgs through some horizontal, family symmetry, often a nonabelian finite group.

			The addition of a family symmetry, what we  call the Higgs group, allows us to place the Higgs, now both the electroweak Higgs and one or more additional Higgs, into a multiplet of our new symmetry. We can couple our new down and up-type Higgs multiplets to a SUSY and family symmetry breaking spurion field(s). We engineer the breaking of our family symmetry to give us one pair of light Higgs states, what is the MSSM Higgs boson, and one or more heavy Higgs states with large F-terms. These heavy Higgs states integrate out mimicking gauge mediation but with additional contributions because there are Yukawa couplings involving our messenger Higgs. The messenger couplings lead to corrections to the usual gauge mediation masses and A-terms, which are now generated at one loop instead of two. </p>

			<p>
			 In the infrared, we see new and predictive SUSY spectra that are reachable at LHC14. Work in this direction has been done before, but our approach generalizes to both extending existing flavor models by adding a Higgs group, to control the Higgs sector, and giving guidance to building new models where the structure of the soft masses are correlated, or anti-correlated, with the structure of the MSSM and SM flavor structure. We are writing this work up now and hope to submit it soon (arXiv:1405.xxxx).

	    		<h3 class="subsection-header">The Two Dimensional Hydrogen Atom</h3>
	    		<p>
	    		My undergraduate <a href="/Users/todd/Downloads/dhg-Skeleton-7ab6820/media/ToddSGaron.Thesis.pdf"download="ToddSGaron.Thesis.pdf" class="download-button" >thesis</a> with Professor Nelia Mann looked at the spectrum of the hydrogen atom if we lived in two spatial dimensions. In this world, Coulomb's law is logarithmic and there are no scattering states. We looked at the spectrum in both relativistic and nonrelativistic formulations and saw that it agreed, at least in terms of functional form, with predictions from the Bohr model. This worked was collected into a paper in the <a href="http://scitation.aip.org/content/aapt/journal/ajp/81/2/10.1119/1.4769785">American Journal of Physics</a>.</p> 

	    		<h3 class="subsection-header">The Relativistic Born-Infeld Hydrogen Spectrum</h3>
	    		<p>
	    		With Professor Joel Franklin at Reed College I looked at the spectrum of relativistic Hydrogen with a nonlinear, Born-Infeld potential to try to constrain the fundamental length scale, an IR cutoff, in the theory. Our work was published in the <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0375960111001733">Journal of Physics Letters A</a>. </p>
