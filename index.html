			<p>I am a physics graduate student at The University of Wisconsin - Madison, working for Professor Lisa Everett in the <a href="http://www.pheno.wisc.edu/">phenomenology group</a>. When at school, I work on parameterizations of the MNSP and models supersymmetry breaking. In my free time, I read quite a bit, cook, and I sometimes watch movies on vhs taps. </p>

      <p> I was born in Los Angeles and grew up in the suburbs of San Fancisco. I left San Francisco to go to Reed College in Portland, Oregon where I worked with <a href="http://people.reed.edu/~jfrankli/">Joel Franklin</a> and wrote my thesis under Nelia Mann. I'm now as you've already read at UW - Madison.
